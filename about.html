            <h2> What is it about?</h2>
            <p> This site is about buying video games and stuff. What else do you think it is about. 
                  
            <p> 
                Get ready for the feel,
                the feel of real. X1.
                No pain, no gain.
                Pizza, guys.
                Whoo-hoo!
                Hello, Wade.
                Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.
                What's the matter?
                Life getting you down?
                I was born in 2027.
                After the Corn Syrup Droughts,
                after the Bandwidth Riots.
                After people stopped trying
                to fix problems
                and just tried to outlive them.
                My parents, they didn't make it
                through those times,
                so I live here in Columbus, Ohio,
                with my Aunt Alice.
                In 2045, Columbus is
                the fastest-growing city on Earth.
                It's where Halliday and Morrow
                started Gregarious Games.
                These days, reality is a bummer.
                Everyone is looking for a way to escape,
                and that's why Halliday...
                That's why he was such a hero to us.
                He showed us that we could go somewhere
                without going anywhere at all.
                You don't need a destination
                when you're running
                on an omnidirectional treadmill
                with quadraphonic,
                pressure-sensitive underlay.
                James Halliday saw the future.
                And then he built it.
                He gave us a place to go.
                A place called
                the OASIS.
                This is the OASIS.
                It's a place where the limits of reality
                are your own imagination.
                You can do anything...
                ...go anywhere.
                Like the vacation planet.
                Surf a 50-foot monster wave in Hawaii.
                You can ski down the pyramids.
                You can climb Mount Everest
                with Batman.
                Check out this place.
                It's a casino the size of a planet.
                You can lose your money there.
                You can get married.
                You can get divorced.
                You can... You can go in there.
                People come to the OASIS
                for all the things they can do,
                but they stay because of all the things
                they can be.
                Tall, beautiful, scary, a different sex,
                a different species,
                live-action, cartoon.
                It's all your call.
                Yeah, that's me.
                Well, that's my avatar.
                At least, until I feel like changing it.
                Except for eating, sleeping,
                and bathroom breaks,
                whatever people wanna do,
                they do it in the OASIS.
                And since everyone is here,
                this is where we meet each other.
                It's where we make friends.
                Locate Aech.
                Locating Aech.
                Aech located.
                Sector 12. Planet Doom.
                Planet Doom,
                the most dangerous place in the OASIS,
                and a pretty great place
                to pick up coin.
                Figures Aech would be there.
                Aech is my best friend in the OASIS.
                He's my best friend, period.
                Even though I've never actually met him
                in the real world.
                - What's up, Aech?
                - Hey, what up, Z?
                Next race is in 20 minutes,
                and I can't do the late one.
                What the hell are you up to?
                Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.
                Is that Daito?
                Daito and Sho.
                This an artifact hunt?
                Yup. Gregarious 120.
                Turn into any giant robot
                for two minutes. That's rad.
                Artifacts.
                Those were key.
                Halliday made sure
                the OASIS was littered
                with enough randomly powerful stuff
                that anyone could win
                if they had the skills.
                Death matches and artifact hunts
                are a good way to coin-snatch,
                but depending on your level of armor,
                they're risky.</p>
